# WaterUsageUSA
A repository of water usage in the U.S. based on data gathered from *AquaStat* a global database created by the [*Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations*](https://www.fao.org/aquastat/en/)

# What we provide
We provide water usage data of the U.S. for years 2019 and 2020. Our repository becomes especially useful for viewing data of the U.S. from the *Aquastat* database, as the *Aquastat* database is hard to decifer for the average user. We provide information on the following variables: water stress, freshwater withdrawal, and water use effiency. Water stress (%) is shown below in comparison with the United Kingdom, a similar country (when comparing GDP and other factors).
