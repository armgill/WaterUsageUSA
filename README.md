 # WaterUsageUSA
A repository of water usage in the U.S. based on data gathered from *AquaStat* a global database created by the [*Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations*](https://www.fao.org/aquastat/en/)

## About
This dataset was created by Arjun Gill on April 25th, 2024. WaterUsageUSA is a repository containg a subset of the *AquaStat* international database, focusing specifically on water usage within the United States. The purpose of the WaterUsageUSA repository is to provide comprehensive data on different aspects such as, water use effeciency, water stress, and freshwater withdrawal. Water usage is a pressing topic, this dataset has potential to spread awareness about the misusage of water. With this dataset specifically detailing the statistics on water usage, our dataset can shine light on an otherwise opaque topic.

## What we provide
We provide water usage data of the U.S. for years 2019 and 2020. Our repository becomes especially useful for viewing data of the U.S. from the *Aquastat* database, as the *Aquastat* database is hard to decifer for the average user. We provide information on the following variables: water stress, freshwater withdrawal, and water use effiency. Water stress (%) is shown below in comparison with the United Kingdom, a similar country (when comparing GDP and other factors).
